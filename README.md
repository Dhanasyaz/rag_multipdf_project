## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Streamlit** – Interactive web interface
* **FAISS** – Vector database for similarity search
* **EURI Embeddings API** – Text-to-vector conversion
* **GPT-4.1-nano** – Answer generation
* **pdfplumber** – PDF text extraction

---

## 📋 Overview

This application allows users to upload multiple PDF files and ask natural language questions about their content. The system uses advanced RAG techniques to:

* Extract and process text from uploaded PDFs
* Split documents into semantic chunks
* Generate vector embeddings for each chunk
* Store embeddings in a FAISS vector database
* Retrieve the most relevant chunks based on user queries
* Generate accurate, context-aware answers using an LLM

Conversation memory remembers your chat history for natural follow-up questions.

## ⚙️ How it Works

The app reads your PDFs, breaks them into smaller pieces, and stores them in a way that makes searching fast. When you ask a question, it finds the most relevant pieces and uses AI to write an answer based on what it found.

## 📝 Note

You'll need API keys for **EURI Embeddings** and **GPT-4.1-nano**, but you can use any similar API that works for your needs. Add your keys in the app before using.
